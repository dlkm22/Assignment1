# Promoting Novelship

**Novelship** is a real company based in Asia focused on providing a marketplace for both buyers and sellers of sneakers, apparel and collectibles.

This project aims to promote Novelship so that more buyers and sellers, especially in the South East Asia (SEA) region, will be inclined to use Novelship as a platform to shop for their sneakers and apparel.

# Design Process

The website is catered to people who are looking for a platform to buy and sell authentic fashion goods in the SEA region. The website offers many details into the benefits of using their platform such as fast shipping and guaranteed authenticity. This project is the best way for people to find out more about Novelship as it is a one stop information hub for most general queries that potential customers may have about Novelship.

- As a potential customer, I want to navigate through the website and find out how to use the platform.

- As an investor, I want to find out what makes Novelship different from its competitors.

- As an onlooker, I want to find out general information about Novelship and how to use it.

# Features

## Existing features

- If the user is accessing the website with a device that has a display of 1060px or less, the navigation bar will compress itself into an easily accessible menu.
- Users can use the navigation bar at the bottom of the website to find Novelship's social media links.

# Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)
  - The project uses HTML to display the contents of the webpage

- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css)
  - The project uses CSS to beautify the page and create effects such as the glowing effect when hovering over the 'Google Play Store' and 'Apple App Store' button on the download page.

- [JavaScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)
  - The project uses JavaScript to implement the responsive menu feature and the solid navigation bar when scrolling down on the website.

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)
 - The project uses FontAwesome for icons such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram , the menu icon and the X icon for closing the menu.

- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
 - The project uses Google Fonts for the fonts such as Poppins and Merriweather.

# Testing

1. Contact form page:
  1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
  2. Submit an empty form with no input and verify that all fields must be filled in order to submit the form.
  3. Submit a complete form with all inputs and verify that it is able to be submitted.

1. Responsive Navigation Bar:
  1. Go to any page
  2. With a website that can test responsiveness, set width of device to at most 1060px
  3. Verify that navigation bar shrinks into a menu page with all links and an exit button

- On devices that can display more than 1060px in width, the navigation bar will show all links.
- On devices that are unable to display more than 1060px in width, the navigation bar will only show the text Novelship and a menu that can be opened to display the other links.

- On Firefox, the website layout looks exactly the same, but the style of the font looks slightly different than on Google Chrome.

- One bug I discovered was white borders appearing when the width of a device gets smaller and smaller. I fixed this issue by making the images and videos resize based on the browsers width.
