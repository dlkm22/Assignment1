# Promoting Novelship

**Novelship** is a real company based in Asia focused on providing a marketplace for both buyers and sellers of sneakers, apparel and collectibles.

This project aims to promote Novelship so that more buyers and sellers, especially in the South East Asia (SEA) region, will be inclined to use Novelship as a platform to shop for their sneakers and apparel.

# Design Process

The website is catered to people who are looking for a platform to buy and sell authentic fashion goods in the SEA region. The website offers many details into the benefits of using their platform such as fast shipping and guaranteed authenticity. This project is the best way for people to find out more about Novelship as it is a one stop information hub for most general queries that potential customers may have about Novelship.

- As a potential customer, I want to navigate through the website to find out more about Novelship.
